# AnatomyMan

# 1. UX
## User Research
Identified key user personas, ie. People who study anatomy, the body, and how it works. The user group would be students of anatomy.

## Project goals
The goals of this project are to produce a fun, interactive game that gives users a different way to continue to learn. It also aims to help the user practice terminology and spelling of various terms used in the field of anatomy.

## User Goals
The user will have easy access to the website features, including an informative instructions page and a interactive hangman game. To achieve responsive design; flexible layouts and a mobile first approach will be used to extended acessiblity to as many screens as possible.


## User Stories
As a visiting user, I would like to access the instructions so that I know the game rules.

As a visiting user, I would like to keep track of my incorrect and correct answers.

As a visiting user, I would like to have an increased challenge of beating a timer.

As a visiting user, I would like to have a clear understanding of which letters are correct/incorrect.

As a visiting user, I would like to have access to hints if I struggle to find the word.

As a visiting user, I would like to know how many attempts I have left to guess the word.

## Design choices
The design aims to be visually appealing, with an interface that is simple. The color scheme reflects a retro colours that are fun and bright, there aa slight colour alteration as the timer progresses, in order to add more interactivity. As well as colour changes when letters are correct. GoodUI was comsulted to help the project follow common and consistent UI/UX conventions.Only High-quality images are used to ensure a positive user experience.  All design choices are made to create an easy to use and easy to naviagte website. The webpage has a traditional 2 page layout with continuity in terms of navbar, footer and content layout. All of these elements remain in the same place on each page. This makes the site easy to learn, use and navigation for the user.

### Styling


### Backgrounds
The design choice of one solid background colour was made to maintain accessibility for the user.
 
### Content
Instructions that guide the user to play the game so the rules are understood and there is no confusion. There is are letter input spaces that will work with the users' keyboard. There is a progressive hangman image that updates as the user gets answers wrong, to eventually reach the well-known fully drawn hanged man.

Designed in balsamiq, there are 2 wireframes for each pages. Providing planned layout and views on large screens, medium screens and small screens.
